# JS-Digital-Timer

The first JavaScript project that I completed entirely by myself: JavaScript Timer, built with pure JavaScript. This project marks the beginning of my journey of becoming a full-stack web developer. This project made me realize my weaknesses and gave me confidence in my strengths. I had a really hard time making this timer work properly, and that's what makes this project so meaningful for me.
